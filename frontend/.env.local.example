# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your values

# TEE Server Configuration
# The base URL where your TEE server is running
# Examples:
#   - Local development: http://localhost:8000
#   - Production: https://your-tee-server.com
#   - Docker/remote: http://your-server-ip:8000
VITE_TEE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Privy Configuration
# Get these from your Privy dashboard: https://dashboard.privy.io
# 
# PRIVY_APP_ID: Your Privy application ID
# This identifies your app to Privy's authentication service
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id_here

# Blockchain RPC Configuration
# The RPC URL for the blockchain network where your Escrow contract is deployed
# This is REQUIRED for the frontend to work properly
# 
# Examples:
#   - Base Sepolia: https://sepolia.base.org
#   - Base Sepolia (alternative): https://base-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com
#   - Ethereum Sepolia: https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com
# 
# Important: This must match the network where your Escrow contract is deployed
# The frontend uses this to:
#   - Query user wallet balances
#   - Query TEE wallet balance
#   - Build block explorer links
#   - Interact with the Escrow contract
VITE_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org

# Chain Configuration (optional)
# The blockchain chain ID your app connects to
# Defaults to Base Sepolia (84532) if not specified
# Other common values:
#   - Ethereum Sepolia: 11155111
